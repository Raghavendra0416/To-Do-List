## Tasks:

### How the Page Should Look:
### Page Structure:

-> How the Page Should Look
-> The side heading of the page should be "Tasks".
-> The page title should be "Added Tasks".


### How the Tasks Should Look:

-> The page Should Show Task content & checkbox on the left. Dropdown should be shown when 
hovered the task.
-> On the left side, there should be a checkbox.
-> The content added by the user should appear in the middle of the task box.
-> Once a task is completed, it should be moved below the "Completed Tasks" section.
-> Completed tasks should appear in a separate section(i.e "Completed Tasks") and 
should be highlighted with a light color.

---------------------

### The Actions the Page Needs to Perform:

-> When the "Add Task" button is clicked, the page should be redirected to another page.
-> If no text is entered in the input box, an alert should be shown asking the user to add a task.
-> The text entered by the user in the input box should be added to the next page as a list.
->  When the user hovers over a task, it should show:
There should be dropDown and the DropDown should contain:
  * A Modify Task button
  * A Delete Task button

-> When the checkbox is clicked, the task should be marked as completed.
-> The completed task text should have a **strikethrough**, and the background color of 
the task should change.

-------------------

### When Hovering Over a Task

-> On the right side, there should be a dropdown menu.
Inside the dropdown, there should be:
  * A Modify Task button to edit the task text
  * A Delete Task button to remove the task

-> Completed and non-completed tasks should be highlighted with a shadow effect when hovered, 
and the task card should slightly move upward.
-> For completed tasks, when hovered over, the task should be highlighted and should 
display two buttons:
  * Delete Task
  * Re-add Task (to move the task back to the Tasks section)
